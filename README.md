## Getting Started

This project is based on the book "Desbravando Java e Orientação a Objetos" by Rodrigo Turini.

If you're interested in understanding how this works, you can access the classes in the "CLASS" directory. In the "SRC" directory, you'll find the main functions for registering a book and creating a sales log.

I'll update a template to explain OOP as soon as possible! Have fun!
